# Python listener.py

The listener requires the keyboard library and will need to run as root. My plan is to run this in a root crontab with a tmux session.

The count.sh file is my "test" of playing and pausing the music player. I will be using mplayer.

The listener.py code could be cleaned up to use an object and not the global keyword everywhere.
